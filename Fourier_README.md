# Steps of Run the Code

## 1. want to run the other file `(*.java)`

[IDEA]( https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ ) is the nice IDE, for this project is built by gradle, what you need do is just clone this repo with using Git：

```shell

And then use IDEA to open the folder `Processing_Tutorial`. Wait for anything is done. Finally, open one of the java file  and right click with you mouse in the background and select Run:

Enjoy it.



## 2. Want run `svg_interpreter (*.pde)` 

[where svg may be typed as svp?]

-   Download the [Processing](https://processing.org/download). I recommend you to use version before 4.0, otherwise some problems may encounter like:

    >   field not found: frame 

-   Unzip it and open `processing.exe`

-   Download [Video Export](https://funprogramming.org/VideoExport-for-Processing/download/VideoExport-23.zip) : https://funprogramming.org/VideoExport-for-Processing/ 

    >   Unzip and put the extracted VideoExport folder into the libraries folder of your Processing sketches. Reference and examples are included in the VideoExport folder.

​	The libraries folder of your Processing sketches is usually in `T:\Documents\Processing` for windows.

-   Download [ffmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z) : https://ffmpeg.org/download.html 

    >   You need to download and install ffmpeg on your system before you can use VideoExport . Note that you might already have it installed! You can find out by typing ffmpeg or ffmpeg.exe in the terminal. If the program is not found

-   Open one of `*.pde` file in  with Processing program and change the path below :
